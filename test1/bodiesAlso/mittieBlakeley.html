	<h3>Story</h3>
	<p>My mom died when I was still a baby, so masta took me in and I was raised with the white children, they always treated me kindly. We used to race to do our chores. <span style="font-size:30px; color:black;">Egg collecting was my favorite chore because I always collected the most. That always got me the ginger cake!</span> I was always treated kindly, but my older brother and sister were treated quite rough.</p>
	<p>Once an older slave displeased master. He had a pit dug and boards placed over it. He then lied the woman down on the boards face down and beat her until the blood gushed from her. She was left there to bleed to death. <!--
I feel sorry for all those who were treated so much worse than any human would treat a beast.
