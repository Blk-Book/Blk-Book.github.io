	<h3>Story</h3>
	<p>Im not sure exactly how old I am because <span style="font-size:30px; color:white;"> the Bible with my birthdate was destroyed in a fire. I think im around 81.</span> </p>
	<p>I remember seeing other slaves tied up to post and whipped but <span style="font-size:30px; color:black;"> as I boy I was not wipped</span>. I also remember when many of the grown ups left to join the Union Army as soon as they heard that Lincoln had made them free. </p>
