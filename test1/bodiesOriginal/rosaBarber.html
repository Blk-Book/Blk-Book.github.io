	<h3>Story</h3>
	<p><span style="font-size:30px; color:black;">When I was a child they give me the name Ellison I kept it after I was free.</span> I was young when freedom come so I dont remember slavery much. My parents died when I was young, and I married Fox not to long after. He has the same name as me because we were owned by the same masta.</p>
	<p>The only thing I remember about slavery was how we were not allowed to learn, and how the only stories or songs we could deal with had to be pre aproved to not teach us anything. <span style="font-size:30px; color:white;">The only freedom of communication we had was songs in the feilds while we worked</span></p>
